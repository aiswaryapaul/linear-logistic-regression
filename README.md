# linear-logistic-regression

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn using both Logistic Regression and Linear Regression. The dataset was explored using detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), followed by model building and evaluation.



🧠 Project Highlights
✅ EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):
In-depth data exploration to understand customer behavior, churn trends, and feature distributions.

📊 Visualizations:

Churn vs Non-Churn distribution

Histograms, Boxplots, and Heatmaps

Correlation matrix and categorical feature analysis

📈 Modeling Approaches:

Logistic Regression for classification (Churn vs Not Churn)

Linear Regression applied as an experimental approach (though it's not ideal for classification problems)

🧪 Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve (for Logistic Regression)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Scikit-learn (model building & evaluation)

Google Colab for interactive experimentation
